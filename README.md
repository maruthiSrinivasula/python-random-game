python random number game

This is python code which generate random numbers from 1 to 6 we want to guess the correct number from 1 to 6 .
if we guess the correct number first time then we get 20 as our score . if we guess wrong number then our score will be decremented by 1.

For simplicity iam using 1 to 6 you can  use any numbers  as you wish in " random.randint(1 ,600)"

here iam using termcolor module for printing coloured text on the terminal. import termcolor in this manner " from termcolor import colored"
To print colored text use in this manner " print(colored("HELLO WORLD !","your colour name"))"

Here iam importing "random" module.

random module is used to generate random numbers.
